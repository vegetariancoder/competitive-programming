# Project Description

This project focuses on leveraging SQL queries and Power BI dashboards to analyze various aspects of customer behavior, sales performance, and operational metrics. Key use cases include analyzing **customer purchase behavior** across demographics, tracking **sales revenue growth** by product categories, and assessing **order delivery performance** for service quality. It explores **payment method preferences** and categorizes customers based on **lifetime value (CLV)** to identify high-value segments. The project also evaluates **review sentiment analysis** to refine product strategies and optimize **inventory management** for sellers. Advanced analytics includes **cross-sell opportunities**, **geolocation-driven market expansion**, **returns and refunds performance**, and **order value analysis**. Insights into **seasonal sales trends** uncover peak sales periods, while detailed **seller performance metrics** ensure performance tracking and sales growth. Overall, the project integrates data-driven strategies to optimize decision-making across multiple business dimensions.

# Solving Business Use Cases :

## Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis:

- Find the top 10 cities with the highest number of unique customers.
- Analyze the average purchase frequency of customers per city or state over time.

## Sales Revenue Breakdown:

- Calculate the total sales revenue generated by each product category over the past year.
- Identify the product categories with the highest revenue and track their monthly growth or decline.


## Order Delivery Performance:

- Compare the average delivery time (order_approved_at to order_delivered_customer_date) for each city.
- Identify orders where the actual delivery date exceeded the estimated delivery date and calculate the percentage of late deliveries.


## Payment Method Analysis:

- Find out which payment methods (credit card, debit card, etc.) are the most popular among customers.


## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):

- Calculate the total spending of each unique customer and categorize them into high-value, medium-value, and low-value customer segments.

## Review Sentiment Analysis:

- Identify the products with the highest number of positive and negative reviews.
- Calculate the average review score for each product category and correlate it with sales performance.


## Inventory Management for Sellers:

- Analyze the number of orders and sales volume for each seller to identify which sellers are driving the most sales.
- Calculate the average time taken for each seller to fulfill an order and identify sellers with consistently late deliveries.


## Cross-Sell and Up-Sell Opportunities:

Identify product pairs that are frequently purchased together (e.g., items in the same order) and suggest potential cross-selling opportunities.
Analyze the impact of offering discounts on certain products on the sales volume of complementary products.


## Geolocation Analysis for Market Expansion:

Map the distribution of customers across various states and identify regions with high sales potential but low current market penetration.
Analyze the proximity of sellers to customers and identify regions where adding new sellers could improve delivery times.


## Returns and Refunds Analysis:

Identify products with a high number of negative reviews and returns (using review_score and order_status).
Track the percentage of refunded orders for each product category and analyze the reasons for refunds based on review comments.


## Order Value Analysis:

Calculate the average order value (price + freight_value) for each product category and analyze the distribution of order values.
Identify the product categories that drive higher order values and compare their sales performance across different regions.


## Seasonal Sales Trends:

Analyze monthly sales trends for each product category and identify peak sales seasons for each category.
Determine which regions have the most significant seasonal variations in sales volume and adapt marketing strategies accordingly.


## Seller Performance Metrics:

Calculate the average rating of each seller based on the review scores for orders they fulfilled.
Track each seller's monthly sales growth or decline and identify the top 10 fastest-growing sellers in each region.
